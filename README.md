# Analysis of Hospital Bed Capacity Requirements Under Growing COVID-19 Patients

_Group project for CSC3170 2021-2022 Term2 in CUHK(SZ)
__Good luck and Work Hard!_  

## Introduction
Our project is going to study the relationship between the number of projected infected individuals by Covid-19 and hospital bed capacity across the United State. And by analyzing the percentage of beds needed and beds available in each state, we can find in which state, the government should increase the investment in medical field and extend the bed capacity. And in an emergency, whether should the hospital send patients to adjacent states.
